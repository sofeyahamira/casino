# How to play
- Type in a bet
- Roll the dice
    - This will be your number
    - It cannot be 20 or less than 10
- Roll another dice
    - This is the winning roll
- If your number is lower than the winning role your bet doubles
- If it is equal your bet triples
- If not you lose your bet
    - You may start again with a new bet and new number
- You may leave any time, but as long as you stay your bet must increase and your number must stay the same
- If you leave without playing (e.i you got a high number and decided to not play) you lose your bet
